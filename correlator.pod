=head1 NAME

correlator.c -- A program for calculating values of several different
correlation function estimators using given data and random samples.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# Hamilton estimator
	./correlator correlation.dat data.dat random_sample.dat 4

	# Landy-Szalay estimator by default
	./correlator correlation.dat data.dat random_sample.dat

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The following arguments must be given, in this order: C<OUT> C<DATA> C<CMP>.
In addition, C<METHOD> can be given.

=over 4

=item *

C<OUT> -- Filename where the calculated data should be stored. 

=item *

C<DATA> -- Filename where to search for the data for which the correlation
function estimator should be calculated for.

=item *

C<CMP> -- Filename where to search for the binomial random field to use in
the Monte Carlo calculation.

=item *

C<METHOD> -- I<Optional.> Which correlation estimator to use. Valid choices
are:

=over 4

=item * 

1 => Peebles-Hauser (1974) estimator.

=item * 

2 => Davis-Peebles (1983) estimator.

=item * 

3 => Hamilton (1993) estimator.

=item * 

4 => Landy-Szalay (1993) estimator.

=head1 FILE FORMATS

All the files are to be in ASCII format, with numerical fields separated
by whitespaces and newlines for human readability.

=head2 RANDOM SAMPLE

The random sample file should have the following format:

	number of points (N)
	data low bound (3 components, separated by whitespace)
	data high bound (3 components, separated by whitespace)
	point 1 (3 components, separated by whitespace)
	.
	.
	.
	point N (3 components, separated by whitespace)

=head2 DATA FILE

The data file should have a format otherwise identical to the random sample
file, except that the following rows should be added to the very beginning of
the file:

	number of scale bins (N_s)
	bin 1 (2 components, low and high bounds, whitespace separated)
	.
	.
	bin N_s 

=head2 OUTPUT FILE

Result in OUTFILE will have one row for each bin, with the following
columns in this order: bin low bound, high bound, value of ksi, Poisson error
