TOOL PACKAGE FOR AMIGA HALO FINDER DATA ANALYSIS

The root directory contains several utility scripts for miscellaneous
halo data analysis operations. These are written in Perl and use the
AMIGA::HaloFinder Perl library, located in the AMIGA subdirectory.

Also in the root directory are programs for calculating two-point correlations
and generating binomial random fields. These are written in C and can be
compiled by verifying the suitability of the included Makefile and running
make. These programs have been documented in corresponding .pod files using
Perl POD documentation. See below for how to generate HTML documentation.


SUBDIRECTORIES

AMIGA/

Contains the .pm files of the AMIGA Halo Analyzer Perl library. The main
class is AMIGA::HaloAnalyzer.

Tools/

Contains several useful Perl classes for tasks not directly related to 
AMIGA data, such as basic statistics.

docs/

Contains a makedocs.sh shell script for generating a HTML documentation tree
from the Perl POD documentation included in the package. The documentation
tree is created in the docs directory.

mersenne/

Contains the original source code (mt19937ar.c, mt19937ar.h) of the Mersenne
Twister pseudorandom number generator by Makoto Matsumoto, Takuji Nishimura
and Mutsuo Saito. This code is used by the fieldgen.c program found in the
root directory.

parallelized/

Contains MPI parallelized version of some of the programs found in the
root directory. These can be compiled by editing the accompanying Makefile to
suit the MPI library in use and then running make.

visualize/

Contains programs for visualizing AMIGA halo data interactively on the screen.
This is done using the SDL library for user interaction and OpenGL for
rendering. The programs can be compiled by editing the accompanying Makefile
to suit the current system configuration and then running make.
